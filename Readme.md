1. When we will tilt the circle, circle will appear as an ellipse.

   general point on an elipse (x,y) = (acos(theta), bsin(theta)) |  x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2 = 1
   general point on an circle (x,y) = (acos(theta), asin(theta)) |  x^2 + y^2 = a^2 

2. the tilt angle can be adjusted by width and height of container  (tan-1(h/w))

   For 0 tilt, put height equal to the width

3. Radius for cicle or a and b for ellipse also will be handled by height and width.

4. Number of dots can be managed by adding more div tags in html file.

5. Speed can be managed by kkeyframes.
